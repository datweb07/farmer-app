# [YDCC Hackathon 2025] [GreenHackers]

## Problem Statement

- **Salinity intrusion** severely impacts the Mekong Delta.
- Farmers lack both **cultivation capital** and access to **reputable credit sources**.
- Farmers face a shortage of effective solutions and **agricultural inputs**.
- Securing direct loans from banks is time-consuming, while **climate change** (specifically salinity intrusion) remains unpredictable.

## Solution Overview

We aim to build an ecosystem connecting three key **stakeholders**: Farmers, **Agricultural Input Suppliers**, and Banks. This ecosystem addresses the critical issues mentioned above by enabling enterprises to supply agricultural products based on **salinity forecasts** generated by our Web Application.

## Key Features

### 1. Salinity Monitoring

- **Interactive Map**: Displays salinity monitoring points on a map using [MapLibre GL](https://www.mapcn.dev/).

### 2. Intelligent Forecasting

- **AI Prediction**: Utilizes **Prophet** for future salinity forecasting.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies upward/downward trends in salinity levels.
- **Early Warning**: Sends notifications when predicted salinity exceeds safe thresholds.

### 3. Community Management

- **Post Creation**: Share information and experiences regarding salinity management.
- **Comments**: Facilitate discussion and exchange among members.
- **Interaction**: Like, share, and follow other users.
- **Project Evaluation**: Rate and review investment projects.
- **Points and Ranking System**: Accumulate points through activities and climb the leaderboard.

### 4. Badge System

- **Achievement Badges**: Earned upon reaching key milestones.
- **Expert Badges**: Reserved for users with outstanding contributions.
- **Progress Tracking**: View progress towards earning badges.

### 5. Notifications and Alerts

- **Real-time Notifications**: Receive instant updates on activities.
- **Anomaly Alerts**: Provides warnings for various salinity levels and suggests corresponding solutions.

### 6. System Administration

- **User Management**: Approve, lock, or unlock accounts.
- **Content Moderation**: Approve posts and comments.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: System statistics and analysis.

### 7. Authentication and Security

- **Login/Register**: Supports email/password and **OAuth**.
- **Profile Management**: Manage personal information, avatars, and stakeholder types.
- **Password Reset**: Via verification code (Work in Progress).

### 8. Advanced Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Reads content aloud via voice synthesis.
- **Responsive Design**: Functions optimally on all devices.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Supports dark and light themes (Work in Progress).
- **Media Upload**: Upload images and videos for posts.
